# MNIST_digits_reader

This repo contains my code for running a Naive Bayes classifier on the MNIST dataset.

'MNIST_SQL_exploration.R' contains my code for downloading the MNIST train and test datasets.
'MNIST_exploration.R' contains my code for examining and cleaning the data.

'mnist_train.csv' contains the MNIST training dataset. The test dataset is excluded as the filesize is too large to store on a free Git repo.

'MNIST_NB_final.ipynb' contains my Python code for running the Naive Bayes model.
'MNIST_NB_final PDF.pdf' is a PDF copy of this code.
